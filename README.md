#  Robot Editor

The Robot Editor is a modelling tool that allows to easily create models of scientific robots.

## Features

   * Geometric modeling: The modelling of new robots requires a tool that excels in modeling of the geometrical components (i.e. meshes).
   * Semantic modeling: Even more important is the ability to allow the description of semantic properties of the robot manipulator, such as the definition of kinematic chain
